        <h1>Promote AP Intermediate Semister Students </h1>
        <p>The April Guidlines Clearly says '<b>In case the situation does not appear to be normal in view of COVID-19, in order
            to maintain “social distancing”, safety and health of the students, grading of the
            students could be composite of 50% marks on the basis of the pattern of internal 
            6
            evaluation adopted by the universities and the remaining 50% marks can be
            awarded on the basis of performance in previous semester only (if available). The
            internal evaluation can be continuous evaluation, prelims, mid-semester, internal
            assignments or whatever name is given for student progression.</b>' 
        So are requesting to government to promote students so that at least we can focus on current semester/year.</p>
